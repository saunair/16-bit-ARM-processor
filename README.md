## About
This is the final year group project that I was part of. It consisted of designing a 16 bit ARM processor based on thumb instructions. The main idea was to simulate on an FPGA, though due to lack of resources we couldn't implement the whole design on one FPGA. Rather we tested individual modules in software and using Nexys-7 board.
